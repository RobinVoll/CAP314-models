Stella and Vensim both have a application that can run on macOS. PowerSim, however does not run on macOS and must be run on Windows.

After downloading and setting up the applications, the model files in this directory can be opened in the right application.

Climate2001_UU_INIT.stmx is for Stella

Climate2001_PowerSim.sip is for PowerSim

Climate_2001VENSIM.mdl is for Vensim.

All settings are already set up correctly, if you want to build the models instead of downloading make sure to use the settings mentioned in the paper, especially important for PowerSim. The equations that are used for these models can be found in the equations files.
